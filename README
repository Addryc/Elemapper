Dusted off after such a long time!

Made Intellij generate the jar file

===================================================================
Version 1.7
===================================================================

Added guards.
Had to include all of xerces.jar as the dependancies were not correctly identified.
Re-included the DTD so old files are still loadable - This will be removed at some point.
Updated to Java 1.5.
Updated to JDom 1.0.

===================================================================
Version 1.6

Update the exit's tab with more information (eg concealed).
Updated the code generated to use DOOR_CHANGE rather than a seperate look function.
Changed the update method as the powerupdate license had expired.
Changed Vectors to ArrayLists for speed.
Added support for functions - This will enable guards to be added.
Removed dependancy on DTD - It was getting hard to make it backwards compatiable.
Updated to Java 1.4.
